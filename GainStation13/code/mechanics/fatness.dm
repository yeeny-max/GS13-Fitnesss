	//Step 1) Grab a thing that will add or reduce fatness!
	//Step 2) Give it a character.hider_add(src) and a character.hider_remove(src) depending on the conditions you want it to meet for which it will add or remove itself from messing with a character's fatness!
	//Step 3) Give it a proc/fat_hide([character argument]), with a return that will give the amount to shift that character's fatness by!
	//Step 4) There is no step 4, you did it bucko!
	//Wanna see an example? Search for /obj/item/bluespace_belt !!!
